# Leading Causes of Death in the Southern Region of the US


## What is the purpose of this data?
* This data provides the number of deaths and the age-adjusted death rates for the top 10 causes of death in the US starting in 1999, specifically focusing on the southern region (Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Arizona).
* This data can be for policymakers and government officials looking for patterns or individuals interested in the leading causes of death in the South

## Where is this data from?
* This data is from the data.gov website pulling data from [NCHS](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states) reports. 

## What can be used with this data and what does it show us?

1. Policymakers and the government can use this data to plan policies and regulations that target causes that increase deaths in the South.
2. This data can help guide healthcare systems in the region to emphasize prevalent conditions, especially chronic conditions that can be improved through lifestyle changes.
3. Public health educators can use this data to create awareness and education about regional health issues and risk prevention.
4. This can help the public understand the leading causes of death and what is a higher risk in the southern region.
